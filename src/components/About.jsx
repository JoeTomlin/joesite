            <h3 className='h3'>I actually like learning</h3>
            <p>" I wasn't always a software engineer. When I graduated from 
                <br/>UC Berkeley in 2018, I looked for roles in the Entertainment 
                <br/>industry and found a job as a Publicity Coordinator managing Red 
                <br/>Carpet Events and early screenings for Universal and Paramount 
                <br/>Pictures.
                <br/>
                <br/>I then transitioned into an Account Manager role at a startup
                <br/>focused on building consumer products made from sustainable materials.
                <br/>I managed over 500 wholesale accounts across the US and spoke to
                <br/>customers about their needs.
                <br/>
                <br/>During the pandemic, I found new work at a SaaS startup called
                <br/>Deputy.com. Their product is a scheduling software that can be modified
                <br/>and scaled to their business client's needs. I got to work hands on with
                <br/>Customers, Solutions Architects, and Products Managers, bridging the 
                <br/>gap between clients and developers but listening, learning, and effectively
                <br/>communicating customer needs.
                <br/>
                <br/>My time at Deputy taught me what I truly value, learning. I especially
                <br/>love learning stuff that I don't already know. I didn't know what an Open
                <br/>API and why that mattered for different systems."
